# ALX Backend Python

Welcome to ALX Backend Python! This repository contains the code for the ALX Backend written in Python.

This code is used to create an API for the ALX application. It provides endpoints for user authentication and data manipulation.

The repository contains the following files:

* `app.py` - The main file which contains the code for the API
* `requirements.txt` - A list of dependencies for the project
* `test.py` - A file containing tests for the API

To get started, clone the repository and create a virtual environment. Install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file, then run `python app.py` to start the API.

If you have any questions or requests, please open an issue or contact Dovineowuor via email.
